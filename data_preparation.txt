# edit the transcript without speakers (bad idea)
1. paste transcript in vim
2. remove speaker lines:
    :g/Sprecher/d
3. check for empty lines or timestamps and remove them

4. remove empty space at the end of each line
    :%s/\s\+$//e

# set a semicolon after 'Sprecher'

The current transcript looks like this:
00:07:59 Sprecher 2Â 
So yeah, now we start with the first question related to Sentire or what you tried out today, can you, ehm

To make the transcript into a list of sentences we need to:
1. set both lines (speaker and sentence) on the same line
2. set a semicolon after 'Sprecher 2'

To do this, we use vim's functions:
1. Join lines where "Sprecher" is followed by a number:
    :g/Sprecher \d/normal J

2. Add a colon after the number:
    :%s/\(Sprecher \d\+\) /\1: /

# Prepare data for strategy 03

Strategy 03 is related to issue #1, so we need a different dataset for each speakers.
To do this we need to sort the text based on the speaker number, we do this with the following vim command:
    :%sort /Sprecher \d\+/ r
Then we save each speaker to a different file.
