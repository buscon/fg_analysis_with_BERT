And the group format of like the Jam.  I let go of like.  Being able to control.  It or be the centre of it.  Either because you know there's a big group and like everybody needs an opportunity to explore it and we maybe explore it in many different ways. So I kind of didn't.  I didn't.  I let myself be outside of it.  And I enjoyed the unpredictability in that.  Uh, of a rather kind of observing where where.  Where it wouldn't come in and not and like within the group.  Within the group or not  And I also like felt myself like at the very end, after Jenny had this moment with the swinging of the sound on her own like.  I had I took the sound piece. I had one sound on my wrist and I had the other sound at the other end of the wire in my hand and like I became.  Like this to have the whole system you know myself.  And and I I felt like the destroyer, you know, like I kind of have like destroyed the actual whole point of it here. And so I think as kind of like holding the limitations of it and then.  Yeah, I don't know.  I didn't, I didn't really know what to do with it like with that point we kind of exhausted the possibilities of it."", ""and would... from this perspective would help to have for example a lower sound.  You know, so that the sound is 'cause the reason one hand is sensory gating, But there is also,Is called multi perception.  And since really how the brain works not only in humans that when you have a multiple stimulus, you have some advantage, you're you perceive better. For example, if you're in a noisy environment.  And you hear a sound that is coupled with a visual information.  It's easier to understand.  So meaning I see a television with a image of a speaker, so a person talking and at the same time hear that voice.  In a noisy environment, it's more likely they understand better what the person is saying. If I had visual information, instead of having only the sound only the speaker saying exactly the same thing at the same volume.   So there are the two sides of it, that's why I was asking whether maybe the sound was was too loud for the interaction, that why it was taking you so much away from it because.  In the end.  What what you're doing when you use Sentire  you have the theory.  And you have a body perception.  These are the two main.  So of course you have also.  Individual aspect you're seeing that.  Person and so on, you know, but.  Those are the two big."", ""But then it is standard.  Yeah, once once contact is established established it's more distracting. I feel once you you.  We need a yeah.  With fear around it getting how close.  That's kind of.  Like the instrument that we could play.  And then in that sense it created a.  An external awareness of.  The space how close it is.  And on the other perspective.  It's yeah it it it.  It takes away the actual feeling of how close can I be to someone 'cause there's the way I I, I know it in my body it's there's the sensation of the nervous system telling me either I'm I'm agitated or you're agitated.  For your calm and that way I I know I can. The distance is appropriate or not.  And the sound is.  That way, like a crutch to to to synthesise that sensation.  And you added, uh, yeah, once I.  Get it I. I don't need it.  So there it could be a tool to.  If we get more of a feeling for it.  And then like, wait, well, just the music stopped and we had it off. I still imagine like this and coming closer to some of them [imitating the sound of getting closer]  Or even just making a sound myself. It didn't do it yet it.  Could be a way to play with it to use the system.  And then we all become the\xa0Sentire. So when someone something is close, I do the sound.  This would be kind of funny and once I touch.""]"
0,77,0_silence_sample_could_sound and,"['silence', 'sample', 'could', 'sound and', 'changing', 'is', 'so you', 'they re', 'hear', 'for']","[""Think that.  We need the idea to have that.  Like these two settings.  You know that you can control how much predictable should it be, because even now when it's random, he's never fully random.  So first he follows that sound environment and second he follows the kind of skills. So if you use it for a while and you touch a lot, you will start to hear the pattern. So there is a certain pattern somehow changing. So it's not only a sequence, but.  In the end, we are talking about maybe maximum 10 notes, so they're not so many so.  But but again, I think it would be bad for that purpose would be to some setting of predictability, maybe 0 predictability.   Medium that changes.  A bit and change a lot that could be.  Probably you have to also be predictability, especially if you use it for for long time you get bored, you know? Let's get that. I mean it's like."", ""But yeah, anyway, thank you for the interview we went through. I wanted to quickly answer you about the sounds.  I mean one idea to have more silence would be it is also maybe interesting for you, but also for you.  Because it's tricky, of course you want to use this proximity and touch and.  At the same time, yet the sound can be too much, so one option we are exploring for an art project we are trying to to use samples and more specifically spoken spoken words.  And the problem is you don't want.  To repeat the.  Same sentence you know. So you want that you really need some silence.  So what we did there is that when the proximity is not changing your silence so you not only have silence when you're far away, so you move and you hear, let's say that the.  This is the sample. Let's assume that this is the sample size.  Do this sample this sample. This sample silence.  So I'm very stupid but easy to understand so so that way you have more chances to have sinais for example."", ""Yeah, once once you have touch, they'll have another layer. One thing I came up with this noise like once I touch.   There, there's, uh.  The sound changes the pitch changes and then it jumps.  To another thing.  And then I let go to have like an echo.  Of of like silence or.  Because I immediately go from very loud to jump back to maximum amplitude.  And then have like like a delay of it building up again. 'cause if I let go and touch it, it's like it's quite confusing and they're having a like a third layer of sound that first comes.  To, uh?   Like once I release the touch.  There's another another soundscape first which blends over into the normal again, and then what I would find it not too tricky actually to have it here to.  Have like a?  Yes no or like 3 settings and each one and the.  The way they're set like they're both on yes, yes, it's it's one sound. Then I can say yes no, then it's that there's not a sound then there's no, no it's the third third sound. So just having having.  On off one off there.  I have the three different kinds of sounds happening which I can like switch into that way.""]"

It was linked to what he said in like at the end that somehow this system helps people to touch or go like maybe closer to each other."", ""Yeah, there's it's quite it. It gets very tricky.  Those are my orders.  And then it's yeah, it's it's more the.  The touch and weight that helps to feel.  And if I'm away, I'm not touching it.  How close am I?

Right. So you're moving away to express something so direct doesn't have to be necessarily communication. Communication is.  More specific, so we express something with our position and with our moving like.  So whether a certain situation where.  Using Sentire today affected particularly.  These two aspects, so the body expression.  More position with body. I'm in more position now  every movement .  And there is maybe something, because I mean, I imagine that in the end, as you say, especially when the guys, I I also think it's any movement does.  But maybe there is something one or two situations you want to report were also related to this.  Like a few situations."", ""I mean, I see already that is a recurring subjects. So of course we changed them.  The setting affects a lot of the experience, so even independently from using Sentire or\xa0 not.  I mean, if you did what you did last weeks, but you did it in such a setting, there would have been also a big change. So of course we are changing we have one more variable now that then.  It's hard, then, to distinguish how much Sentire is responsible, or how much the setting so.  Yeah. We still, I would say we still go this way, so.  Feel free to mention the setting as much as you want, and so yeah, next question will be about your bodily feeling. So again this German word Körpergefühle  An emotion, a feeling connected to a bodily sensation  So whether there was something like that today."", ""No, you're welcome to share any, so there was the whole point of this interview to share any thoughts you don't have.  To please me.  Just the.  Yeah, I mean these these questions are meant to be.  The reaction of a topic and then you can share really any opinion. don't be afraid about it.  So another aspect of.  Body perception, but goes a bit away so did Sentire help or didn't help.  And how in the body communication with another person and also movement communication?  We may be partially covered before, but in this case there is the aspect of communication and not so much of perception.   It might be helpful to add this before and after, so when you use Sentire, how did you communicate with your body and with your movement, and how did you do it After that can maybe help to see also different space""]"

So the second one was the two persons with eyes closed in that case and only moving their arms.  And and the audience was generally quite engaged, of course was not a full long session. Usually was 5 minutes, first one 5 minutes, second one and then next person. Next person was meant another sound. So there was a bit of variety.  I mean, I never really measure and ask everyone of the audience, but as a general feeling, let's say that I saw quite a few times it was engaging so.  Well, right, so it's, it's for sure a way to externalising what you're feeling, even though I have no idea what you're actually feeling here.  And yeah, then you can go to your next questions.   Whether you can imagine maybe we'd be setting of today to use the system as part of your work practice.  Workshop with your participants.  Would that be for you? For example for?  Now, authentic movement workshops such as setting interesting?"", ""One moment.  Like I am.  I see the two people having the bracelets.  And I just.  Just kind of run through them being a conductor.  Kind of went out and hearing the sound.  So being there distracted in a way and passing through and yet connecting the sound.  So it's making me yeah, playful in that sense.  And another situation is I am walking.  Kind of their time.  More tense than usual and more.  I don't want to do something wrong with this game  So my body language is more more.  Like introverted, and yet I'm trying to.  Peek out and.  See if I if I touch them. They're very pointy and.  And so it affected me a lot in that sense.  Let's see.  We almost.  Yeah, a bit afraid and like shouting myself.  And yet, like.  Piercing out.  And, uh.  Yeah, maybe feel.  a bit confused and unsafe.  It was.  Yeah, so that was situation and.  Now imagine it, yeah, having quite the impact like doing iconic jam itself. It was a big thing. And then yeah, being the Guinea pig of it.  Yeah, like create a lot of yeah, intense experience.  It it intensified the whole thing, you know and made it.  Yes, hold something new.  Having those kind of toys."", ""Yeah, I enjoyed it.  Having a understanding in the room of the system.  So what is actually happening in the Sentire system, that, uh?  It it helped a lot.  to get some clarity.  Then then there's some confusion still stay.  And from there.  I'm playing with the yeah, the group dynamic of basically having one end and the other end the person with Sentire.  And in between you have the people dancing, so they are free and as long as they touch fully touch.  A Sentire and the other B Sentire.  They can move quite freely and still have the.  Have that sensation and creating like a circle and a bigger.  Delicate composition.  Use these words of  Yeah, moving bodies which become one system.  Like feeling the simplicity of.  The system that it is, it's just. It's just a circuit, nothing else. And then we can all create a circuit by giving a circle and if one person let's go, it affects the whole room the whole sound.  So another person, let's go, and it doesn't change anything because the circuit is still closed. That created a lot of fine moments.  For me or I'm like using the hand where Sentire is and.  Actually, it doesn't matter if it's like there's nothing special about the hand that has the breast...bracelet.  All of your body is as relevant.  By creating a funny.  Observable moments in me like this.""]"

It's the third time, so I'm kind of I already know what to expect, so it's not like at all like it's not surprising or.  I know your sound and.  It was the both times. It was very.  Different and the.  The first time, what I did [unclear]  The samples it was reminding me of computer game.  I felt like we were somewhere in 90s. You know this old.  Old computer games and it was.  Affecting a lot what we were doing.  In the sense.  That it was very playful and and it was affecting with the quality how we were touching each other.  And and then with Kira, the sound was more like legato drony flow, like very different sound you chose  And was totally different experience and different movement quality with Kira and with her. Also there was a lot of.  Like I think we first we were composing a lot and and playing and with Kira. It was. I felt like we were caring.  Like there was this caring touch like.  Really like compressing each other."", ""Yeah. I think for me like the most like like when I have like the clearest expression where because there's also a.  Lot to do with the images.  In the beginning, when there were no sound and we were waiting a sound and what was happening there.  Because then it becomes also quite abstract, you know.  And then it's like like then I can talk about like what was happening in our movement to you, I don't know. I I cannot.  It's very difficult to relate to this.  Question or like what? What do you like?  What you want to know  For me, like there was like it was crazy how we started, it was it was so like.  Like like very private little space. You're like facing each other.  You know.  And and then.  The purpose is to touch.  And then, like you know, was was taking a shirt out.  And then I was like. 00:49:52 OK. I also will take.  Like yeah, it was giving a lot of associations like. 00:49:57 A lot of.  Images but the situation.  Could be, you know and then.  I felt like there was like also like this, you know.  Like this moment is.  Very strong when you first time you enter this private space with someone and suddenly.  Told you too.  And you are facing with each other and you are like looking each others eyes and with Kira also I felt like there was something like.   You know, one has to really connect with one own own body and and like.  Before, like being able to or also she closed her eyes for a moment because we were also waiting. Long time, you know, and like more shyness somehow it was was more like property.  Yeah. For me, please. So for me, there was this was like the strongest."", ""There was a moment like on a few moments with Kira, where emotions were very clear.  Like what? Like I mean.  I think that's what you're asking.  About like there was.  A kind of period at the.  Beginning where we were sort of flirting, I would say. Or she kind of was pulling gestures and like closing her legs and.  Then holding her hand.  And then I kind of copied it the other way and there was like this sort of like.  Yeah, giving something but taking something away, the sort of feeling.  That was, yeah, teasing. Like so, there was something of, like, feeling a bit edgy in this this moment. And it happened again later on.  And then there was also, like, a few moments where it was really like ohh right hand. I think it was both times my right hand like joined what must have been her left hand. So like this moment where?  It was like, Oh yeah, we're we're we're committing to this like strong grip hold like strong like.  Yeah, I want this, but there might have been some touch. There was touch going on or had been and then there was like now we go deeper and and that happened twice.  Like once when we were standing once when we were crouched on the ground and we both really late.  The second time we really looked at this hand and it was like, oh, what happens here also with the sound and things.  Yeah, there was something of kind of.  Relief and assurance and and.  a yes, I know.  Consistency and simplicity of something in this in this moment.  And an ongoingness, maybe the white noise for example, that I spoke about before, that was like the background conversation, very light again.  A little bit, yeah.""]"
