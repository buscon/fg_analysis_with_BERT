Do much more. Although we've had a really nice run. Let's just leave it as that and now.  We're kind of going and drifting into this like.  Extended territory were really not so interesting and actually.  Just wanting to be with like.  Oh, that was really fun. That was there. But.  You know not.  Not prolonging it.  I try not to judge it too much. It stayed quite light, but I did leave.  There was also another there was another moment, toward the beginning"", ""Publish related to this research and possibly also part of a research project. But yeah, whether in a format of a paper or other kind of.  Of research publishing and also in that case there will be no names, so there will be only.  The speak speaker and number and some quotes of what you said. So if you're.  And yeah, it's important for me to know that you're OK with that. And in case they are not OK.  For example, Mario already mentioned that it was something that he said last night that she would like to maybe remove or correct this time.  You're very welcome to do it, so whether you tell me no please that part, it's whether it's not true or I.  Change my mind.  And you can correct it in the next interviews or also later on. You can also write me and say, well, that's"", ""Thank you was fine for you.  That is perfect, so final steps.  And the the other aspect that was a bit underlying in all my questions, but I found it.  Especially after the way we shared information at the at the end today I. I mean, this is considering our focused interviews, but it actually overlaps with another method that comes from phenomenology, so that's a bit actually what you what you rather lead actually.  I ask you to do meaning talking first person about a specific moment, so I really try to reenact that experience.  Uhm, so actually the I didn't want to overload you with this research information that are not directly relevant to the question I'm posing, but I think it's also it does affect. Also the way you answer.  And so you're very welcome when you answer the question or or or better say when we discuss the quest you know together also to.  Take really specific moment you experience today.  And reenact them, so go really not only going deep and in detail, but also try to experience them again in a present sense and with a.  So I.  Uh, I smelled this. I heard this. I felt this so you're very welcome to do that.""]"

Like these two settings.  You know that you can control how much predictable should it be, because even now when it's random, he's never fully random.  So first he follows that sound environment and second he follows the kind of skills. So if you use it for a while and you touch a lot, you will start to hear the pattern. So there is a certain pattern somehow changing. So it's not only a sequence, but.  In the end, we are talking about maybe maximum 10 notes, so they're not so many so.  But but again, I think it would be bad for that purpose would be to some setting of predictability, maybe 0 predictability.   Medium that changes.  A bit and change a lot that could be.  Probably you have to also be predictability, especially if you use it for for long time you get bored, you know? Let's get that. I mean it's like."", ""But yeah, anyway, thank you for the interview we went through. I wanted to quickly answer you about the sounds.  I mean one idea to have more silence would be it is also maybe interesting for you, but also for you.  Because it's tricky, of course you want to use this proximity and touch and.  At the same time, yet the sound can be too much, so one option we are exploring for an art project we are trying to to use samples and more specifically spoken spoken words.  And the problem is you don't want.  To repeat the.  Same sentence you know. So you want that you really need some silence.  So what we did there is that when the proximity is not changing your silence so you not only have silence when you're far away, so you move and you hear, let's say that the.  This is the sample. Let's assume that this is the sample size.  Do this sample this sample. This sample silence.  So I'm very stupid but easy to understand so so that way you have more chances to have sinais for example."", ""It could be.  What I'm saying is just you, you just have a basically 1 battery thing, let's.  Play on and off.  And that that.  Way I just jump like this on off to two things. There's 3 possibilities, and each one has a different sound.   So it could be quite simple in way to do.  If you can have the buttons is connected   Be like.  Which would I think is quite easy to actually achieve, so that way the the people can choose between 3 preset layers with you as the sound linear panels change, and that way you can create a more of a game as well and create sensitivity for the.   The kind of sound that is happening.  Like playing the game like.  on is yes and off is no. And.  You actually listen to the sound.  And yeah, having a set of sounds that is.  Ambient and creates a feeling which again has to be individual like. Fortunately every sound is different for everyone, yet there's dramatic amount.  Yeah, it's sound talents and you already have that.""]"

Made me, as I said, more aware of the relationship.  I mean, it's hard to say. Does it make me more aware of the  Other body like.  Or person.  I feel yes and no. Still like, I feel like there's more information going on with the sound.  And and I never know, you know, I can never know what Maria's experiencing.  But I can sense and I can like.  Sense, you know, through my touch or through, like, just sitting with her or, you know, I get some some sort of information, but I don't know that you know what she's still feeling.  So like, yeah, I kind of.  Yeah, I don't know.I think there's a little bit of like.  With the playfulness that come about, both with both partners with Kiera and Maria, like interacting and playing with sound like there's a little bit of me that's like has a bit of uncertainty around the experience of the other more because of the playfulness.  Like it takes me a while to.  Like trust.  Like in that.  This might sound really crazy."", ""Like experiencing a sense of overwhelm like that. That's something that I experience actually in my life.  And and so like feeling quite over stimulated by the sound.   And not not not knowing the kind of ground.  Way of experiencing my like body, which I do on a quite introspective level, right?  Yeah, it does bring up like patterns that I see in my.  Life like there's a there's a so.  [pause 5 secs] And I and I feel kind of a a little bit. Maybe there's a little layer of shame around having quite a strong reaction to something.  Where maybe I'd like to collaborate with it more.  Or work with it, and yet there's a a strong reaction, and I'm not.  Sure why that is.  That means that I like to give it a bit more space.  Or go away from it, or have a level of impatience with it and and so there's a. There's a I feel.   Like I'm in.  The inner process, and yet there's a wish to understand, like.  More about that that process.  Because it does, it does.  It brings it brings up this this."", ""I think part of my.  a little bit more about my emotional feeling, state response.  It's just that.  Like in this scenario, which I really enjoyed.   For German, having space so that.  But the the level of trust that I had with myself was perhaps decreased because like in interactions with people, I mean.  Yeah, it used comes bit in response to Marios talking about how safe. Well like there's a feeling that I don't know how this person is going to respond or what.   You know what I'm going to do? Is it arbitrary or this touch, you know, is it arbitrary? As in, is it just there for the sound or like the actually the level of safety?  That I feel with somebody, and by that I mean trust.  As another deeper layer of safety is also like.  It takes quite some time to like generate the submitting.  And I think, yeah.  I don't. 01:15:11 I don't know.  I think that that happens.  More when I dance with people in a duet.   For a longer time and then when I'm done saying like the just for a short period with people, it's not so established.  And then this.  Like layer of sound like.  Took it more away.  Sorry, I'm not maybe making myself that clear.""]"
2,128,Touch,"['perceive', 'sensations', 'perception', 'communication', 'interaction', 'sensory', 'interacting', 'movement', 'sensing', 'brain']","[""Yeah, as we are at the end I think I will share.  Also, my opinion that.  I always try to hold back a part.  Of very few moments.  I mean, I see what you mean.  On one hand, on the other hand.  And even though I like technology in general, I also have my big issues with that, so I can relate to what you're saying.  The case of something like Santeria I and that's why I'm so motivated to work with that in studies.  Destroy is a little bit of virtual reality, as we've seen before, but on the other hand, I see it very different from virtual reality because you're actually interacting in the real.  World, it's just.  Giving a different quality to the to the real world, you know, because I'm still interacting with you.  We are here in the same room while Bobby we see each other. We just have this extra layer that is also what you were saying.  A bit at the beginning, it brings you another modality of connect perceiving. You know that it can be also misleading, can be exciting. Some people are triggered with some, but."", ""What I can tell you from the performance is yes, was quite the case, you know, because we had, as I said, these two scenarios.  So the second one was the two persons with eyes closed in that case and only moving their arms.  And and the audience was generally quite engaged, of course was not a full long session. Usually was 5 minutes, first one 5 minutes, second one and then next person. Next person was meant another sound. So there was a bit of variety.  I mean, I never really measure and ask everyone of the audience, but as a general feeling, let's say that I saw quite a few times it was engaging so.  Well, right, so it's, it's for sure a way to externalising what you're feeling, even though I have no idea what you're actually feeling here.  And yeah, then you can go to your next questions.   Whether you can imagine maybe we'd be setting of today to use the system as part of your work practice.  Workshop with your participants.  Would that be for you? For example for?  Now, authentic movement workshops such as setting interesting?"", ""and would... from this perspective would help to have for example a lower sound.  You know, so that the sound is 'cause the reason one hand is sensory gating, But there is also,Is called multi perception.  And since really how the brain works not only in humans that when you have a multiple stimulus, you have some advantage, you're you perceive better. For example, if you're in a noisy environment.  And you hear a sound that is coupled with a visual information.  It's easier to understand.  So meaning I see a television with a image of a speaker, so a person talking and at the same time hear that voice.  In a noisy environment, it's more likely they understand better what the person is saying. If I had visual information, instead of having only the sound only the speaker saying exactly the same thing at the same volume.   So there are the two sides of it, that's why I was asking whether maybe the sound was was too loud for the interaction, that why it was taking you so much away from it because.  In the end.  What what you're doing when you use Sentire  you have the theory.  And you have a body perception.  These are the two main.  So of course you have also.  Individual aspect you're seeing that.  Person and so on, you know, but.  Those are the two big.""]"
3,124,Sound,"['touching', 'touch', 'sensation', 'touched', 'interaction', 'interact', 'sound', 'feel', 'moments', 'distracted']","[""There was a moment like on a few moments with Kira, where emotions were very clear.  Like what? Like I mean.  I think that's what you're asking.  About like there was.  A kind of period at the.  Beginning where we were sort of flirting, I would say. Or she kind of was pulling gestures and like closing her legs and.  Then holding her hand.  And then I kind of copied it the other way and there was like this sort of like.  Yeah, giving something but taking something away, the sort of feeling.  That was, yeah, teasing. Like so, there was something of, like, feeling a bit edgy in this this moment. And it happened again later on.  And then there was also, like, a few moments where it was really like ohh right hand. I think it was both times my right hand like joined what must have been her left hand. So like this moment where?  It was like, Oh yeah, we're we're we're committing to this like strong grip hold like strong like.  Yeah, I want this, but there might have been some touch. There was touch going on or had been and then there was like now we go deeper and and that happened twice.  Like once when we were standing once when we were crouched on the ground and we both really late.  The second time we really looked at this hand and it was like, oh, what happens here also with the sound and things.  Yeah, there was something of kind of.  Relief and assurance and and.  a yes, I know.  Consistency and simplicity of something in this in this moment.  And an ongoingness, maybe the white noise for example, that I spoke about before, that was like the background conversation, very light again.  A little bit, yeah."", ""Yeah, I enjoyed it.  Having a understanding in the room of the system.  So what is actually happening in the Sentire system, that, uh?  It it helped a lot.  to get some clarity.  Then then there's some confusion still stay.  And from there.  I'm playing with the yeah, the group dynamic of basically having one end and the other end the person with Sentire.  And in between you have the people dancing, so they are free and as long as they touch fully touch.  A Sentire and the other B Sentire.  They can move quite freely and still have the.  Have that sensation and creating like a circle and a bigger.  Delicate composition.  Use these words of  Yeah, moving bodies which become one system.  Like feeling the simplicity of.  The system that it is, it's just. It's just a circuit, nothing else. And then we can all create a circuit by giving a circle and if one person let's go, it affects the whole room the whole sound.  So another person, let's go, and it doesn't change anything because the circuit is still closed. That created a lot of fine moments.  For me or I'm like using the hand where Sentire is and.  Actually, it doesn't matter if it's like there's nothing special about the hand that has the breast...bracelet.  All of your body is as relevant.  By creating a funny.  Observable moments in me like this."", ""I didn’t find this sounds comfortable.  I felt that the first sound, it was very harmonic.  I didn't personally like the sound which was the sound of touch like suddenly.  This key, keyboard sound  And then after, when you stayed in touch.  It went to cello and that was very beautiful like I found that sound very very beautiful and.  I felt like wow.  This found actually the what it creates.  In me is that it  I want to stay in contact.  Like in physical conduct, because the sound then I was like yeah wow like actually it's very important like which kind of sound you choose if you want.  To really work with.  With the touch.  Because then we are. We are actually touching through sound and not so much touching through sensation.  Of feeling because this I already last time discovered like for me it doesn't work in that way, It's very auditive.  And then.  And this keyboard sound I would.  Not personally key, I will change it and I would like totally go into very very harmonic harmonic sound.  In this case.  But also I was thinking of very compositional this time.  so it depends also what you want. Of course, what's your focus and which sound you choose.  And an I...  the first sound was for me, very beautiful, like the sort of sound I personally like. The second was not like so much my type, but I actually found it more interesting.  Because it was unpredictable.  And it was.  Yeah, because the sound was not.  Because it was different keys, like different notes and different quality of of sound. So it was.  Yeah, so the 1st.  Sound you knew already was coming when you thought?  And the second you didn't know. So in a way it was more. It was like as a compositional tool. It was definitely more interesting.  But the first sound I've.  I felt like, wow, actually because I was because I'm a bit busy myself with.""]"

Because of Sentire took you more time to create some safety of the interaction with another person, did I understand correct?"", 'No, no problem. No, no. You can ask me anytime about that. So the question is about.  Body expression and movement expression. So if you want to simplify you can use communications body communication or movement communication.', ""Can you can you recall moments where it helped to explore the expression of your movement or your body expression so?  Right. So you're moving away to express something so direct doesn't have to be necessarily communication. Communication is.  More specific, so we express something with our position and with our moving like.  So whether a certain situation where.  Using Sentire today affected particularly.  These two aspects, so the body expression.  More position with body. I'm in more position now  every movement .  And there is maybe something, because I mean, I imagine that in the end, as you say, especially when the guys, I I also think it's any movement does.

Longest period of working with the system today was when I was with.  Jenny in the middle.   Yeah, mostly we're not like also interrupting, but we're quite long [unclear]  And I've actually. I remember it wasn't just Jenny but like wanting to explore this thing of proximity. And when it started to sound, and I think my leg was lifted.  One left leg was lifted and the sounds stillness right.  Engage, so there's kind of tension attention.  That I wanted to keep.  And then, like.  Yeah, I didn't know whether I. 00:55:57 Maybe the problem Is dancing as well [laughing]   Like trying to keep nice movement somehow, or like some kind of aesthetic in this because it creates an aesthetic and aesthetic atmosphere that's like quite beautiful with sound and like I enjoy this and there's attention to it. And then like I'm also trying to move in a way that's graceful.   Or like still be in this and then something breaks, so it's like.  I don't, yeah, it's fine, maybe I'm.

And just just to give you a very short context of it so.  So on one hand I totally understand what you mean and so that it would be actually the opposite of what I'm hoping with this question.  The basic concept is.  You know, for most people coming closer to someone.  You're not so much aware of it. You know you usually don't play much consciously about that apart. Apart there is another more dangerous situation, or you're.  With your beloved person, you know in some specific situation, then maybe you. You do pay conscious attention of and getting closer to someone.  But otherwise we.  Do it all the time and you don't really play with that.  You are a specific case. You know this group because I mean your dance work, your semantic work.  Is actually about that so.  So the basic idea for most people was to would be to have sound to make something.  To say hey look  Here you're getting close to someone."", ""But I think also we need to be, uh, understand like what, what? What is our?  Focus for dancing like are we dancing contact improvisation. Or are we doing an\xa0ensemble\xa0improvisation?  And if if nothing, then like.  It's like apart from using the system\xa0\xa0because if we dance contact improvisation, it's different. Of course they can. They always.   Many times in a champ situation they overlap, but still like if we dance. If you do a like a group and ensemble work, it's very often even without the system we would not engage in one person.  Yeah, so so I think it's also good to notice that.  And and.  Like example, I was I didn't have any kind of focus on contact improvisation. There was touch for sure, but I didn't try to engage with the person and have like a longer contact or trio. I didn't really share wait in that sense.  What I usually do when I dance contact   And it would be different if we would have decided beforehand, like hey, let's.
