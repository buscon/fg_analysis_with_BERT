Or like for you what's happening in your party. And of course like this like already last time last time we shared so many times like yeah it doesn't really like bring you more like the awareness or like interceptive awareness or.  That it's even.  Like that's maybe it makes you a little bit.  You away from there?  Of course it has the potential to bring you awareness of  The body in space, the body in relation to other parties, so like proprioception and and like totally it has that kind of possibility.  But also.  This is again the question. It will be work."", ""Yeah, like I like it.  I lost my curiosity.  Let's say, like I, I was like fun.  To play and.  Then I saw OK. Now I know how it is and then I had like.  OK, maybe now it would need something from the group you know to add a score or something to make a little bit more complicated. Or I don't like some new ideas how to how to work with it.  Boredom is mild.  And if you which comes out for you.  And then I was stepping out and I was watching. I was really enjoying to watch, and just listen. And then.   Uh, I was still curious enough to step in.  At least two times.  So it's I didn't feel like I had like.  From these coming up."", ""Thank you was fine for you.  That is perfect, so final steps.  And the the other aspect that was a bit underlying in all my questions, but I found it.  Especially after the way we shared information at the at the end today I. I mean, this is considering our focused interviews, but it actually overlaps with another method that comes from phenomenology, so that's a bit actually what you what you rather lead actually.  I ask you to do meaning talking first person about a specific moment, so I really try to reenact that experience.  Uhm, so actually the I didn't want to overload you with this research information that are not directly relevant to the question I'm posing, but I think it's also it does affect. Also the way you answer.  And so you're very welcome when you answer the question or or or better say when we discuss the quest you know together also to.  Take really specific moment you experience today.  And reenact them, so go really not only going deep and in detail, but also try to experience them again in a present sense and with a.  So I.  Uh, I smelled this. I heard this. I felt this so you're very welcome to do that.""]"

I mean, even though I broke all the kind of set up and like, you know, came off the seat and like.  Yeah. I just. I really like the, like the closeness of the interaction.  Yeah. And I really liked playing with. I feel like this Sentire has something strong with the being with the distance and the space in between the touch. Like for me, it's always more interesting to be like just before the touch.  Not always. But then yeah, I was playing more with the musicality.  Of it and the.  I'll say something about something else like I like. Can we play, Like, can I just give you touch at some point or like, can I just and we had an interaction where I put my hand on.  On your back.  Or like I hobbled my hand over like one side of your back quite a while.  And then.  Like touch.  And this like for me, was like a moment of tracking what was.  My sensations in my body, as well as being with the sound and there's like much more bigger experience that was like more complex.  I say bigger because this was so like this being sound being made because Mario's movements and feelings and yeah, kind of energy in this situation and.  Yeah. Like I was kind of supported by this and.  This this kind of enclosed space and the.  The closeness [unclear] interaction."", ""There was a moment like on a few moments with Kira, where emotions were very clear.  Like what? Like I mean.  I think that's what you're asking.  About like there was.  A kind of period at the.  Beginning where we were sort of flirting, I would say. Or she kind of was pulling gestures and like closing her legs and.  Then holding her hand.  And then I kind of copied it the other way and there was like this sort of like.  Yeah, giving something but taking something away, the sort of feeling.  That was, yeah, teasing. Like so, there was something of, like, feeling a bit edgy in this this moment. And it happened again later on.  And then there was also, like, a few moments where it was really like ohh right hand. I think it was both times my right hand like joined what must have been her left hand. So like this moment where?  It was like, Oh yeah, we're we're we're committing to this like strong grip hold like strong like.  Yeah, I want this, but there might have been some touch. There was touch going on or had been and then there was like now we go deeper and and that happened twice.  Like once when we were standing once when we were crouched on the ground and we both really late.  The second time we really looked at this hand and it was like, oh, what happens here also with the sound and things.  Yeah, there was something of kind of.  Relief and assurance and and.  a yes, I know.  Consistency and simplicity of something in this in this moment.  And an ongoingness, maybe the white noise for example, that I spoke about before, that was like the background conversation, very light again.  A little bit, yeah."", ""I didn’t find this sounds comfortable.  I felt that the first sound, it was very harmonic.  I didn't personally like the sound which was the sound of touch like suddenly.  This key, keyboard sound  And then after, when you stayed in touch.  It went to cello and that was very beautiful like I found that sound very very beautiful and.  I felt like wow.  This found actually the what it creates.  In me is that it  I want to stay in contact.  Like in physical conduct, because the sound then I was like yeah wow like actually it's very important like which kind of sound you choose if you want.  To really work with.  With the touch.  Because then we are. We are actually touching through sound and not so much touching through sensation.  Of feeling because this I already last time discovered like for me it doesn't work in that way, It's very auditive.  And then.  And this keyboard sound I would.  Not personally key, I will change it and I would like totally go into very very harmonic harmonic sound.  In this case.  But also I was thinking of very compositional this time.  so it depends also what you want. Of course, what's your focus and which sound you choose.  And an I...  the first sound was for me, very beautiful, like the sort of sound I personally like. The second was not like so much my type, but I actually found it more interesting.  Because it was unpredictable.  And it was.  Yeah, because the sound was not.  Because it was different keys, like different notes and different quality of of sound. So it was.  Yeah, so the 1st.  Sound you knew already was coming when you thought?  And the second you didn't know. So in a way it was more. It was like as a compositional tool. It was definitely more interesting.  But the first sound I've.  I felt like, wow, actually because I was because I'm a bit busy myself with.""]"

Right. So you're moving away to express something so direct doesn't have to be necessarily communication. Communication is.  More specific, so we express something with our position and with our moving like.  So whether a certain situation where.  Using Sentire today affected particularly.  These two aspects, so the body expression.  More position with body. I'm in more position now  every movement .  And there is maybe something, because I mean, I imagine that in the end, as you say, especially when the guys, I I also think it's any movement does.

So of course we changed them.  The setting affects a lot of the experience, so even independently from using Sentire or\xa0 not.  I mean, if you did what you did last weeks, but you did it in such a setting, there would have been also a big change. So of course we are changing we have one more variable now that then.  It's hard, then, to distinguish how much Sentire is responsible, or how much the setting so.  Yeah. We still, I would say we still go this way, so.  Feel free to mention the setting as much as you want, and so yeah, next question will be about your bodily feeling.

To please me.  Just the.  Yeah, I mean these these questions are meant to be.  The reaction of a topic and then you can share really any opinion. don't be afraid about it.  So another aspect of.  Body perception, but goes a bit away so did Sentire help or didn't help.  And how in the body communication with another person and also movement communication?  We may be partially covered before, but in this case there is the aspect of communication and not so much of perception.   It might be helpful to add this before and after, so when you use Sentire, how did you communicate with your body and with your movement, and how did you do it After that can maybe help to see also different space""]"
