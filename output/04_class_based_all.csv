So of course we changed them.  The setting affects a lot of the experience, so even independently from using Sentire or\xa0 not.  I mean, if you did what you did last weeks, but you did it in such a setting, there would have been also a big change. So of course we are changing we have one more variable now that then.  It's hard, then, to distinguish how much Sentire is responsible, or how much the setting so.  Yeah. We still, I would say we still go this way, so.  Feel free to mention the setting as much as you want, and so yeah, next question will be about your bodily feeling. So again this German word Körpergefühle  An emotion, a feeling connected to a bodily sensation  So whether there was something like that today."", ""Can you can you recall moments where it helped to explore the expression of your movement or your body expression so?  Right. So you're moving away to express something so direct doesn't have to be necessarily communication. Communication is.  More specific, so we express something with our position and with our moving like.  So whether a certain situation where.  Using Sentire today affected particularly.  These two aspects, so the body expression.  More position with body. I'm in more position now  every movement .  And there is maybe something, because I mean, I imagine that in the end, as you say, especially when the guys, I I also think it's any movement does.  But maybe there is something one or two situations you want to report were also related to this.  Like a few situations."", ""No, you're welcome to share any, so there was the whole point of this interview to share any thoughts you don't have.  To please me.  Just the.  Yeah, I mean these these questions are meant to be.  The reaction of a topic and then you can share really any opinion. don't be afraid about it.  So another aspect of.  Body perception, but goes a bit away so did Sentire help or didn't help.  And how in the body communication with another person and also movement communication?  We may be partially covered before, but in this case there is the aspect of communication and not so much of perception.   It might be helpful to add this before and after, so when you use Sentire, how did you communicate with your body and with your movement, and how did you do it After that can maybe help to see also different space""]"

You feel like you and and the external world. And there like this sensation. It's it's fading.  Of course you can. Still, you still feel your body, but somehow like the the just the the material so and another body that's like.  It's so like close to you are you are so.  In you don't feel.  So strong strong pound that is of your own skin.  Or or your own structure or.  Yeah, your body.  But it was not like a truck[unclear] like experience, where you totally lose.

Because it always requires quite a lot of trust."", ""I I think I'm coming from such a.  Right part of I think my struggle with this is that I'm coming from such a particular world that what it means to feel my body and what is kind of.  I give privilege to.  Is like being able to sense, perhaps like.  The shifts in.  my organs or like where my weight is and.  Subtle sensations and Sentire it does not.  Help me to do that.  It it.  Brings out my senses to like a bit like Jenny was referencing to like it opens another form of sensing.  That I'm not so accustomed to, and maybe This is why I kind of.  Struggle with it a little bit.  I'd say from my intuitive and my perspective as a dancer, somatic practitioner, that no, but.  It opens something else in a different way of perceiving and sensing that.  Perhaps I could accustomed myself to, you know, I could become much.  More embracing of.  If I'm able.  To leave behind this other this other way."", ""Because now we are planning this question of body feelings.  and actually, I mean we have all different feelings like every.  It's emotional, it's in the.  Body, but it just depends. But yeah, like like what what? You usually focused on them. You still get focused on emotion but not so much what's happening in the body.  and, Like example, like I.  Could also say.  Like I definitely had a like.  Moments of joy.  While I was playing like I remember this one moment, I had a bracelet and also Kira and then we were coming closer to each other and then like accidentally we touched it each other and then getting.  This big sound and it was really funny because it was not meant to.  Like the touch didn't feel so strong, you know, but the sound.  Was really strong and I remember we're laughing  And there were at the moment, so so we're laughing. So definitely there was a lot of joy and and there were feelings, but not in a.  Way that I was....  Acknowledging what's happening in my body.  You know?""]"

I mean, of course I think it's general when you use the system, it's always a constrain of the work specific work you're doing. So I also don't imagine it as.  A tool for.  I was only.  Now speculating, I just wanted to to hear from your side that.  Whether the wireless  Version with this limitation is is really an improvement to the cable.  Version or not, you know."", 'You think would?  That how much that would be.  Of a problem in the.  Thinking of how we use it, there are few times so in the whole room.  And thinking of today. So I guess that the other.  Times you probably.  The fent went everywhere, today probably the feet.  Were mostly on the floor, but not.  Also always had remember that scene with you and Kira and Kira with her feet around your head, for example.  So what do you think? How much would be that of a limitation problematic for you to say? Maybe I prefer the cable one. Then in that case.', ""Yeah. No, no, no. I understand the the problem and is The thing is, you know, especially if you're sitting, you have your knee very close. So even if you do like this, you feel like.  Very last question because it relates to what the development of the wireless version that we are doing.  So it's not fully ready yet, but it works pretty decently.  What could be a problem, especially for what I saw you using the system. Is that now it's not a bracelet anymore, it's.  something you put on your shoes. It's on both shoes. And the reason is because it does touch the floor. So the system basically the sensor doesn't work.  If there is no, is not connected to the floor, somehow this connection between these two antennas let's.  Say it works.  Thanks to the floor. Crazy thing. I don't know what's exactly why, but anyway it's like this so.  But first, the way you use it especially as dancers.  if you raise your feet up in the air  Screw up the the signal anyway, So what do?""]"
